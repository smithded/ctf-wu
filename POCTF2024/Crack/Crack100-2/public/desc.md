# Crack 100 - I Have Written Down My Secrets
## 100 Points

Summer breaks are great, but I can't stand the downtime. I need to keep my mind occupied. I need a project, a puzzle, a challenge. It's not about staying productive, per se. I just need to keep this mind moving or I'll get bored. I've found the hobby that is presently perfect without being too invested: Learning languages. Simple, no-pressure, infinitely valuable, and a great intellectual challenge. This summer I went a little overboard and overindulged in Duo's offerings. I spent at least a few hours every day learning Spanish, French, German, Italian, Russian, Mandarin, Arabic, Finnish, Hindi and Swedish. I know, that's obviously way too many languages to attempt at once, but it's easy to over-commit and spread myself thin when there are so many wonderful options available. French was actually my focus this summer. I had so much fun learning that I would over-zealously do extra lessons. Is Duo the best way to learn? Non! Am I really learning all that much in the end? Occupez-vous de vos oignons! After a summer of learning am I able to even communicate at all in French? Absolument pas! Je te dis, c'était mieux que de mater les JO à Paris cet été.
