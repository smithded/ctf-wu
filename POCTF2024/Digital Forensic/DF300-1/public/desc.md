# DF 300 - It's All in the Hips
## 300 Points

Somehow, I've ended up with a collection of security cameras. Mostly from POCs. You know, working on security you sometimes vet physical security systems. Particularly if they have large IT requirements and deal with potentially sensitive data. Well, because they're never in service I just sort-of keep them laying around. However, I came in after break one morning and noticed one of the cameras was not in it usual place. Suspecting a set-up (I am always wary of people trying to grass me up) I examined the camera. What I found was astounding. Seems the camera went on quite an adventure in the night. Not sure who's responsible, but t seems they had fun.
