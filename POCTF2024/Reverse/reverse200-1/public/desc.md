# Reverse 200 - Planned Obsequence
## 200 Points

In the lower-level RE challenges, I typically leave the flag or an encoded version in the code for participants to extract. This time, I've redacted the flag in the original code. If you look, you'll see it there. But don't worry, the obfuscated flag is there, buried in a variable somewhere. If you want to get it back, find the encoded flag and reverse the encoding process. It's a two-step process before you convert it back to ASCII so you will know if you're on the right track after just a few characters.
