# Reverse 200 - Constructed Languages
## 200 Points

Here's a reverse challenge with a familiar format. A few tricks, like a redacted flag, but otherwise your objective is as you expect: Locate the flag, reverse the function that scrambled it. However, I have a confession. I did this one backwards, and if you like you can likely restore the flag manually once you figure out how it was transformed.
