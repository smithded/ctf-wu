# Stego 100 - Things Said and Unsaid
## 100 Points

So there I was connected to the free McDonald's Wi-Fi hackin' the ISS nav computer as it passed by from orbit and I intercepted a still image from one of the onboard camera feeds. Something about it just seems a little odd, but I can't quite place it... Then again, it might just be my face-blindness acting up!

Remember, this is a Stego challenge. A password will be required to solve the challenge, and that means the password will also be hidden somewhere in the challenge.
