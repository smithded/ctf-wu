# Misc 100 - I Never Knew Glory
## 100 Points

A famous phrase from a famous play,
Spoken before the Franco-fray,
Five words that stir the English heart,
To make the soldiers play their part.

Part one of third of Harry Five
The very first words of kingly drive
Dear friends, once more - you've gone too far
Beyond Harfleur is where you are

Humble words to leet of speak
Then claim the flag and don't be meek
Celebrate your grasp and reach
Of once more, dear friends, unto the breach
